SCEE is a modified version of StreetComplete, aimed at experienced OSM users unhappy about the lack of advanced editing capabilities in normal StreetComplete.
By default, most of the additional capabilities are disabled. Go through the settings (either in the app or [below](#differences-to-streetcomplete)) for details.

Please be aware that SCEE is not suitable for people used to discarding warning messages without reading!
Users new to OpenStreetMap are best advised to use [StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete).

Functionality added in SCEE is considerably less tested than what you might be used to in StreetComplete, so bugs or unexpected behavior may happen. If you encounter any, please report the issue.

[<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663460/26973090-f8fdc986-4d14-11e7-995a-e7c5e79ed925.png" alt="Download APK from GitHub" height="80">](https://github.com/Helium314/SCEE/releases/latest)

F-Droid releases of SCEE make use of reproducible builds, so releases on F-Droid and GitHub are signed with the same keys. This means you can switch between GitHub and F-Droid releases anytime without needing to uninstall first.

__F-Droid anti-feature__ _non-free network_: SCEE uses map tiles provided by [jawg](https://www.jawg.io), and optionally [aerial / satellite imagery](https://server.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer) by [Esri](https://www.esri.com) .

## Translations
Translations for strings added in SCEE can be done [using Weblate](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/scee/).
You will need an account to update translations and add languages. Add the language you want to translate to in _Languages_ -> _Manage translated languages_ in the top menu bar.

## Permissions
SCEE asks for two more permissions than StreetComplete: `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`. Both are requested and used only in feature to notify about nearby quests while the app is in the background.

Database and preferences files are compatible with StreetComplete, so if you have root privileges you can transfer them in either direction.

## Contributing quests
The original [contributing guidelines](README_StreetComplete.md#contributing) are still valid, but note that the [guidelines for contributing a quest](QUEST_GUIDELINES.md) have been significantly relaxed:
* Creating, moving and deleting nodes is possible
  * Inserting nodes into a way is possible
* Guidelines are useful suggestions, but not enforced
* Quests may be based on external sources like Osmose, not just on element selection

## Changeset differences compared to StreetComplete
This section is aimed for people trying to decide whether a bad edit done in SCEE is fault of the user or of the app (SCEE modifications).
In general, SCEE changesets will contain changes very similar to StreetComplete changesets, with following differences:
* `created_by` is set to `StreetComplete_ee <version>`
* _AddBuildingType_ has additional answers `barn`, `sty`, `stable`, `cowshed`, `digester`, `presbytery`, `riding_hall`, `sports_hall`, `tent`, `elevator`, and `transformer_tower`
* _AddCrossingType_ may change `crossing_ref`, `crossing:markings`, and `traffic_calming`
* _AddPathSurface_ and _AddRoadSurface_ have additional surfaces `metal_grid` and `stepping_stones`
* _AddMaxSpeed_ may tag `maxspeed:conditional`
* [Discardable tags](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Discardable_tags) are removed automatically 
* Any node may be moved, even if it is part of a way or relation
* Any node may be deleted, or have all tags removed if it's not free-floating
* `check_date:*` may be added without resurvey
* Wheelchair quests may add `wheelchair:description` and `wheelchair:description:<language>`
* An element at the same position as a note may be edited (this is blocked in normal SC)
* Most quests may apply to an extended range of elements (user-defined)
* Starting with SCEE 52.0, some answers create separate changesets with comment `Other edits in context of: <orignal quest changeset comment>`.
This happens for changes that can occur in StreetComplete, such as moving or deleting a node, changing shop types, removing surface, changing highway to steps and removing sidewalks.
Furthermore SCEE adds new answers leading to such a changeset comment:
  * All quest types related to roads / paths may adjust access tags
  * Quests types asking about about benches, picnic tables, recycling containers, bicycle parkings and sports tracks/pitches may tag `access=private`
  * All quest types related to buildings may change `building` to `demolished:building`
* SCEE contains some additional [quests (scroll to bottom)](app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/QuestsModule.kt) and [overlays](app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/overlays/OverlaysModule.kt), recognizable in the files by `EE_QUEST_OFFSET`
  * They usually do not fulfill the requirements for StreetComplete, and need to be enabled by the user first
* There are further "quest types" (though neither quests nor overlays, they are identified in `StreetComplete:quest_type` changeset tag)
  * _TagEdit_: may modify any tag
  * _AddNode_: adds nodes, free floating or part of ways, (may change tags of existing way node instead of inserting a new one under some circumstances)
